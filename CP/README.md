Instances for the Circle Problem (CP) in AMPL format. 

In the CP, n aircraft are uniformly located on the circumference of a circle and heading towards its centre. All aircraft are assumed to be at the same altitude.

All instances contain the following data (NM stands for Nautical Mile):

n number of aircraft  
v0 aircraft initial speed in (NM/h)/100  
cap aircraft initial heading  
x0 aircraft initial x-coordinate  
y0 aircraft initial y-coordinate  
d separation norm in NM/100  
radius radius of circle on which aircraft are initially located in NM/100
